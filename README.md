**Pre-processing techniques**

- [ ] handling categorical data
- [ ] handling missing data
- [ ] handling noisy data
- [ ] perform EDA (Exploratory Data analysis) for dataset

**Further Analysis - Regression or classification**
For the aforementioned problem, I've gone with classification as we're predicting a binary outcome. Whether or not the patient will show up to their appointment - yes/no, true/false, 1/0.

Regression would be used if we were predicting a continuous value, like the number of days a patient has to wait in order to get an appointment or be seen by the doctor.
